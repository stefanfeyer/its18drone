Readme for AR.Drone 2 person following
======================================

Run the program as follows:
    ./drone_main.py

Required are:
    - Python 2
    - OpenCV
    - Numpy
    - Imutils
    - Pygame

There are some command line parameters for the program:
    - --fake-video [PATH], use a video file as input instead of drone camera stream
        (make sure that laptop is not connected to actual drone then)
    - --record, record drone camera stream to a file
    - --record-hud, record whole displayed HUD to a file

The following keyboard keys can be used in the program:
General:
- ESC: Quit program, disconnect from drone
- f: Toggle autopilot on/off
- comma and dot: jump in video (if --fake-video is used)

Manual flying (sent commands always overwrite autopilot):
- Enter: Takeoff of drone
- Space: Land the drone
- Backspace: Emergency landing
- W and S: Fly forward / backward
- A and D: Fly left / right
- Up and down: Fly up / down
- Left and tirhgt: Turn left / right

In order to follow a person, you have to start the drone first, fly to the
person manually and then enable following.
